## Challenge Details

- Custom input type names were used in the HTML to avoid conflicts with native browser functionality. For example, `type="number"` is a native input type, so we used `type="formattedNumber"` instead. This means that you could use `document.querySelectorAll('input[type="formattedNumber"]')` to select the inputs.
